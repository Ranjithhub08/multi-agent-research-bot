# Research Report: Future of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) 2025

## 1. Executive Summary
The landscape of Artificial Intelligence is shifting from monolithic LLMs to distributed **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**. By 2025, agent orchestration will be the primary bottleneck and value-driver in enterprise AI.

## 2. Technical Intelligence (Researcher Data)
- **Decentralized Execution**: Agents are moving away from simple API wrappers to autonomous goal-seeking entities.
- **Inter-Agent Communication (IAC)**: Development of standardized protocols (like Agent-Protocol) for JSON-based task handoffs.
- **Small Language Models (SLMs)**: Use of task-specific models (Gemini Nano, Mistral 7B) for individual node efficiency.

## 3. Adversarial Analysis (Critic Feedback)
- **Constraint**: Latency in multi-hop reasoning remain high.
- **Risk**: Feedback loops between agents can cause recursive "hallucination spirals."
- **Mitigation**: Required "Human-in-the-loop" (HITL) checkpoints in critical production graphs.

## 4. Synthesized Framework
The proposed architecture utilizes **LangGraph** for cyclic state management, ensuring that agent memory is preserved across the entire research lifecycle.

## 5. Conclusion
Multi-Agent Systems represent the "Second Wave" of the GenAI revolution. The transition from *chatting with AI* to *orchestrating AI* is complete.
