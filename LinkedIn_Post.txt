🚀 Excited to share my latest project: The Autonomous Research Grid! ⚡️

I've been working on building a Multi-Agent Intelligence Swarm that can deconstruct and synthesize any complex topic in seconds. 🤖🧬

Key Features:
✅ 4-Agent Orchestration (Researcher, Critic, Synthesizer, Writer)
📟 Real-time Swarm Console to watch the agents think
📥 Instant Markdown Export for research reports
🌌 Premium Glassmorphism UI for a cinematic experience
🛡️ Autonomous Simulation Mode for 100% uptime

Built with: React 18, Spring Boot 3, Spring AI, and Framer Motion.
