# 💎 System Features

## 🕵️‍♂️ Multi-Agent Intelligence Swarm
State-of-the-art orchestration of 4 autonomous agents. Each agent has a distinct personality, toolset, and responsibility, ensuring high-quality research output.

## 🌌 Glassmorphism 2.0 UI
A premium, cinematic user interface built with:
- **Neon Gradients**: Dynamic backdrops that shift based on system state.
- **Motion Blur**: 128px Gaussian blurs for depth.
- **Framer Motion**: Stage-based transitions and stage-aware animations.

## 🛡️ Autonomous Simulation Mode
The application is designed to work even in the most hostile environments (no internet, no API key, no backend). The **Antigravity Engine** simulates agent behaviors locally, perfect for demos and offline development.

## ⚡ Zero Latency Feedback
Optimistic UI patterns coupled with real-time agent status updates mean the user is never left wondering what's happening. The system provides constant feedback through the **Dynamic Swarm Visualizer**.

## 📝 Markdown synthesis
Reports are generated in professional Markdown format, supporting headers, bold text, lists, and citations, ready to be exported to any documentation tool.
